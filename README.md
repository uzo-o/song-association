# Song Association
Elle Magazine's Song Association interview format in a JavaFX game

## Description
Song Association is a game that tests the user's musical knowledge.
There are 15 rounds per game; during each round, you are given a
random word and have 10 seconds to sing a song which features that
word in its lyrics. If you succeed and can identify the song, you 
get a point. Building on this basic premise, this program displays 
the user's time and score, as well as the running average of these
values while the user has not quit. It also presents the user with
the playlist of their answers in the form of easy-access YouTube
and Spotify links. Play in light mode to match Elle's pretty-in-pink
aesthetic or in dark mode to rest your eyes. The starting file of 
525 example words (stored in data folder) can be expanded for
nearly infinite gameplay.
